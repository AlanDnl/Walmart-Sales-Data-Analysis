# Project Walmart Sales Data Analysis

## Project overview
------

This project aims to explore the Walmart sales data to understand top performing branches and products, sales trend of different products, customer behaviour. The aims is to study how sales strategies can be improved and optimized. The data was obteined from the [Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting)

"One challenge of modeling retail data is the need to make decisions based on limited history. If Christmas comes but once a year, so does the chance to see how strategic decisions impacted the bottom line." 
"...job-seekers are provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments, and participants must project the sales for each department in each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact."

Despite this challenge was several years before, I'm practicing how to do EDA in some examples or projects and this one is interesting for me.
